# Release Notes

v2.9.8 (October 12th 2024)
===

Hi again,

Another few weeks have passed and another update to D&D Beyond's website has broken Beyond 20. This update fixes the recent issue of being unable to roll items/weapon attacks. It also adds support to some of the new 2024 rules and minor bugfixes.

**Note**: The v2.9.8 update fixes a small issue with To Hit detection which slipped through the 2.9.7 release from the day before.

As always, thank you to [@dmportella](https://linktr.ee/dmportella) for his contributions and to everyone who supports the project, and thank you to my generous [Patrons](https://patreon.com/kakaroto) and [Ko-fi/Github](/rations) supporters.

Enjoy!
